I make computer programs.

I've programmed in BASIC, Z80 and 8088 Assembly, DOS batch files, Pascal, C,
C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, shell scripts, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Objective-C,
Swift and probably some other languages.

I have a few small apps available on the Apple App Store:

These days, I'm building great software at [@eyenov-solutions][Eyenov]. Before,
I worked in other places you can learn about on [LinkedIn][]. Sometimes I answer
programming questions on [StackOverflow][]. I publish code here on GitHub for
others to freely use when creating their own programs.
